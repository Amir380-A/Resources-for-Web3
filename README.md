# Resources for Web3
In this repository, I will try to add resources for Web3 and Blockchain Development.

If you want to contribute, please do.
# Introduction:
 First, if you don't know, you should know the basics of how a Blockchain works: 
Here is a simplified video to help you understand the overview:

but the more in-depth theoretical video from 3blue1brown Channel, which is actually very good and covers most of the fundamental topics with concetration of one of the blockchain's application, cryptocurrency, you can repeat it if you want until you understand it fully:

At this moment, it is important to understand the concept of "Smart Contracts", here is video to understand it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2HxTmxfrI

That should be it. We can now start developing and making these smart contracts using Solidity.
Sources for learning Solidity:

**Note**: This roadmap/ resource is primarily for developing on the Etherum Blockchain itself, but to make a Full-Stack Project, you have to also learn Front-end technologies like Reactjs, vue, Angular or even Flutter and integrate them with smart contract using libraries like Web3.js or Ether.js

# Tools used:


Some tools you can use in development:
- Remix IDE 
- Truffle or HardHat frameworks
- OpenZeppelin for the standardization of the Smart Contract.
- MetaMask- wallet extension
- Ether.js or Web3.js for interacting with the Blockchain.
- Chainlink- for bringing the off-chain data to the on-chain Smart - Contracts (Blockchain) through fetching any desired data from   APIs and getting it on-chain.


# Applications on Blockchain:
- Cryptocurrency
- NFT
- DAPPs
- DAO
